# All the Fishes! - *Kate Falkowski*

## How it was made

Background Sprites (Plant, Sand, and Shipwreck) were placed behind the sea creatures, with the exception of the shark, and have no animation.

The sea creatures, excluding the shark, are animated with a sine wave so that they have a smooth up-down/side-to-side movement.

The shark, placed in the back of the scene and moves across it's enviroment. His animation resets once he reaches the end of the screen.
